## Game Idea
The game follows the story of a girl who was warped through time and needs to find her TimeMachine to go back to her proper timeline.

Basically you would need to fight dinosaurs and collect weapons until you can defeat the main boss and reach your TimeMachine.

## Steps
 * Collect images and sprites for the player, enemies and map;
 * Install proper packages to load the files to the game;
 * Create the scenes with phaser 3 to each element of the game (Preload, Tutorial, Scores, WorldScene, BattleScene, GameOver and GameFinished).

## Gameplay

The player will move using the arrow keys and the interaction with the game is through the menu and the space key to select the options on the battles. 

## Results (Update)

As I progressed developing the game and was implementing the battle scene (commit history shows that), I had some difficulties working with the sprites for the game and realized that I would not be able to implement the battles for the game as I wanted and finish it in time.

So, I changed my objectives and implemented a game where the player would be spawn on the world and just be able to collect item though the map, to add some difficulties and generate a score, I made it so there would be a timer and the player must collect as many dinosaur eggs as possible.

This allowed me to focus my priorities and finish the game in the requested time.

I hope to come back and implement the full game as was intended.
